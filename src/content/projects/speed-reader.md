A web app designed to help you read faster and retain more. Load articles by URL or paste text directly, then read at your own pace with adjustable WPM (words per minute).

## Features

- **Adjustable reading speed** - Control WPM to match your skill level
- **Multiple input methods** - Load articles via URL or paste text directly
- **Reading history** - Track what you've read over time
- **Fully local storage** - All data stays in your browser, no account needed
- **Playback controls** - Play, pause, skip forward/back through content
- **Progress tracking** - See word count and elapsed time as you read
- **Fullscreen mode** - Distraction-free reading experience

## How It Works

The app uses rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) to display one word at a time at your chosen speed. This technique eliminates subvocalization and reduces eye movement, allowing for faster reading while maintaining comprehension.
