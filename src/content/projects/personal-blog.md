This is the site you're looking at right now. I built it to have a simple, fast place to write about software development.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Astro 5
- **Styling**: Plain CSS with custom properties
- **Content**: Markdown with Content Collections
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Features

- Dark/light mode with system preference detection
- RSS feed and sitemap generation
- Tag-based organization
- 95+ Lighthouse scores
- Zero client-side JavaScript (except theme toggle)

## Design Decisions

I wanted something that felt technical but not cold. The combination of serif headlines and monospace body text creates a distinctive look that signals "developer" without sacrificing readability.

The `[BRACKETED]` tag style is borrowed from Greptile's aesthetic—it adds visual interest without being distracting.
