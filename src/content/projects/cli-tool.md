A sample project placeholder. Replace this with your actual projects.

## What It Does

This CLI tool automates common development workflows:

- Scaffolding new components
- Running linting and formatting
- Managing environment configurations

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g example-cli
```

## Usage

```bash
example-cli generate component Button
example-cli lint --fix
example-cli env switch production
```

## Why I Built It

I found myself running the same sequences of commands repeatedly. This tool bundles those workflows into simple, memorable commands.
